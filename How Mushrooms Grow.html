            <h3 id="grow">Mushrooms can grow extremely fast when compared to plants. Mushrooms will grow almost anywhere as long as they have a good supply of nutrients and water. Mushrooms will commonly be seen growing around decaying plant or animal matter or even faeces.</h3>
            <h3 id="spread">Mushrooms can release thousands of spores at once that are then carried by the wind to allow them to spread and grow more mushrooms. As a result of this a single mushroom can essentially multiply in a small timeframe.</h3>
            <h3 id="roots">Often when there are large clusters of mushrooms in one place their roots can become intertwined. When this happens it can connect all of the mushrooms together. This allows them to share nutrients and moisture and it also allows them to catch more water during rainfall as it essentially increases their ground coverage.</h3>
