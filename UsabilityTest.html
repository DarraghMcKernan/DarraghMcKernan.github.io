<h1 id="Test-Title">Summary.</h1>
<h4>Overall i found teams to be a very well designed website that was easy to use and accessible even to people that</h4>
<h4>wouldn't be as familiar with computers. I did not discover any problems with the site as it was so well labelled</h4>
<h4>that it was easy to navigate. I feel that after using the site for even 10 minutes most users will be capable of</h4>
<h4>Performing all tests with ease. I would have liked to have done a Create a new team test but because I am a</h4>
<h4>student I did not have the ability to do so. I feel this would have been an appropriate expert test.</h4>
